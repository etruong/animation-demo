# animation-demo

This demo will show how to use css animation. There are 2 ways to animate: using transitions or animations. Transitions are used to animate elements once a specific property has occurred (such as an addition of a class or a hover over element). CSS Animation, on the other hand, are used to animate elements without having a specific property change, in other words, the animation will occur immediately.
